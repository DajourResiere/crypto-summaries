The Ardor testnet is open to everyone. The main purpose of this is to allow users to test the various features of Ardor so that the developers can fine-tune the blockchain platform for the mainnet launch in the third quarter of this year. When using the Ardor testnet, please remember not to use your Nxt passphrase for security reasons. Note: If you have ARDR tokens, do NOT send them to the address you create on the Ardor Testnet. Please send them to a Nxt Wallet from Nxt.org as ARDR is currently an asset on the Nxt blockchain until its launch in Q3..
