Titcoin (Ticker Symbol: TIT) is a type of digital currency called a cryptocurrency that uses pornography on a decentralized peer-to-peer network to manage the issuance of new currency units while simultaneously processing transactions. Titcoin is a derivative of the bitcoin source code with key modifications to the software which greatly improve transaction speeds and network difficulty readjustments. Titcoin is exclusively designed for and marketed towards the adult entertainment industry to allow owners of the currency to pay for adult products and services without the fear of incriminating payment histories appearing on their credit cards.
Titcoin is notable for being the first altcoin fully recognized as a legitimate form of currency by a major industry trade organization. In 2015, Titcoin received two nominations at the 2015 XBIZ Awards ceremony which honors companies that play an essential part in the growth and success of adult entertainment. In 2016, Titcoin was nominated for a second year in a row as Alternative Payment Services Company of the Year at the 2016 XBIZ Awards.
As of Mid-2017, it has a very low total market capitalisation of about 100,000 USD
