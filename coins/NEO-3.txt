The Daily Stormer is an American neo-Nazi and white supremacist news and commentary website. It considers itself a part of the alt-right movement. Its editor, Andrew Anglin, founded it on July 4, 2013 as a faster-paced replacement for his previous website Total Fascism.
The site is known for its use of Internet memes, which have been likened to the imageboard 4chan and cited as attractions for a younger and more ideologically diverse audience
