The Daily Stormer is an American neo-Nazi and white supremacist news and commentary website. It considers itself a part of the alt-right movement. Its editor, Andrew Anglin, founded it on July 4, 2013 as a faster-paced replacement for his previous website Total Fascism.
The site is known for its use of Internet memes, which have been likened to the imageboard 4chan and cited as attractions for a younger and more ideologically diverse audience. While some white nationalist authors have praised The Daily Stormer's reach, others have taken issue with its content and tone, accusing Anglin of being an agent provocateur, used to discredit true white nationalism.
The Daily Stormer orchestrates what it calls the "Troll Army", which is involved in Internet trolling of figures with whom Anglin disagrees politically. In August 2017, after causing outrage by insulting the victim of a ramming homicide at a far-right rally, the website was rejected by several domain registrars and moved to the dark web.
