ISO 4217 is a standard first published by International Organization for Standardization in 1978, which delineates currency designators, country codes (alpha and numeric), and references to minor units in three tables:
Table A.1 – Current currency &amp; funds code list
Table A.2 – Current funds codes
Table A.3 – List of codes for historic denominations of currencies &amp; funds
The tables, history and ongoing discussion are maintained by SIX Interbank Clearing on behalf of ISO and the Swiss Association for Standardization.
The ISO 4217 code list is used in banking and business globally
