The nonprofit Stellar Development Foundation supports the Stellar network and protocol with the goal of providing efficient and low-cost global financial services. The network's distributed ledger records money as credit issued by third parties such as banks and payment processors. Credit is issued to a user's online wallet in exchange for a deposit and can be sent to others in the network for a low fee. Currencies are automatically exchanged at the lowest rate via Stellar's distributed exchange. Lumens, the native asset of the Stellar network, help to secure the network and provide liquidity for multi-currency transactions.
