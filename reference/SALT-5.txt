The SALT Lending Platform uses borrowers' blockchain assets as collateral, eliminating the need for credit scores and streamlining the lending process. Borrowers store their collateral in SALT's secure wallet throughout the life of a loan. The platform automatically matches borrowers with capital (in traditional fiat currencies) from its network of lenders. This allows borrowers to leverage their crypto assets for cash quickly and easily without having to sell their long-term holdings. SALT tokens are ERC20 tokens that represent membership in the platform.
